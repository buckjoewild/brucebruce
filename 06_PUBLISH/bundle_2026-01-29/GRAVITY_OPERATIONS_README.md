# GRAVITY — OPERATIONS

Mantra:  
Feeling is the weather. I am the ground.

This system exists to reduce chaos, preserve clarity, and enable steady progress
regardless of mood, energy, or pressure.

---

## Roles

**FOREMAN (Human)**
- Sets intent and direction
- Approves scope changes
- Decides what matters
- Owns outcomes

**OPERATOR (AI)**
- Executes only within defined scope
- Verifies before acting
- Makes minimal, reversible changes
- Logs all work
- Stops when unclear

No role overlap.

---

## Operating Principle

We do not rely on motivation.  
We rely on structure.

Confidence is produced by completion.  
Clarity is produced by verification.

---

## Allowed Scope

### WRITE
- C:\GRAVITY

### READ-ONLY
- C:\Users\wilds\harriswildlands.com

### SUPPORT (read/execute only as needed)
- C:\Users\wilds\Desktop\UV

Anything outside this scope requires explicit Foreman approval.

---

## Mandatory Execution Rhythm

Every task follows this order:

1. VERIFY  
   Confirm current state. No assumptions.

2. PATCH  
   Apply the smallest change possible.

3. TEST  
   Prove the change worked.

4. LOG  
   Record what happened and why.

5. PUBLISH  
   Package artifacts into a dated bundle.

If any step is skipped, the task is not complete.

---

## Logging Standard

All work must result in a log entry under:

C:\GRAVITY\04_LOGS

Logs must include:
- phase labels
- evidence of verification
- summary of changes
- final status

Logs are factual, not emotional.

---

## Publishing Standard

Completed work is copied to:

C:\GRAVITY\06_PUBLISH\bundle_YYYY-MM-DD__topic\

Bundles contain:
- work artifacts
- session log

The local filesystem is the source of truth.  
The website is the map.

---

## Redaction Rule

Never record:
- tokens
- API keys
- credentials
- private identifiers

If a secret appears:
- stop
- redact
- note that redaction occurred

---

## Stability Rules

- No broad scans
- No unnecessary optimization
- No multitasking
- One task at a time
- Proof over polish

When uncertain:  
Pause.  
Verify.  
Ask.

Silence is better than drift.

---

## Definition of Done

A task is complete only when:
- scope was respected
- changes were minimal
- tests passed
- log exists
- publish bundle exists

Completion creates confidence.  
Confidence compounds.

Proceed grounded.
