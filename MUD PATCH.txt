Implement MUD wiring now.
In C:\GRAVITY\HW_ENV\repo\structure\01_MUD_SERVER_CODE\ locate the telnet server command handler (process_command or equivalent).
Add a command: dev buildstub that:

requires armed+consent from the existing mode state (use per-player state if present)

calls orchestrator.build_loop.run_build(...) (or the equivalent function already written)

uses the codex_adapter stub (no real Codex yet)

writes one event line to structure/evidence/event_log.jsonl with durable:false

consumes the build cycle (snap back to PLAN) so the next dev buildstub is blocked until re-armed
Provide: (a) diff, (b) exact telnet manual test steps + expected output.
