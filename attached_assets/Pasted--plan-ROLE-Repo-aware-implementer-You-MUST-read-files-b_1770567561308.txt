ROLE: Repo-aware implementer. You MUST read files before claiming where to change anything.

GOAL: Integrate the new HARRIS WILDLANDS ASCII LOGIN BANNER so it appears as the first “landing” output when a user connects to the MUD (web terminal via WebSocket). Keep it purely cosmetic: NO gameplay, orchestrator, or governance changes.

BANNER (exact text to add; keep spacing):

Under what name shall your deeds be recorded?

REQUIREMENTS:
1) Show banner to each connecting client BEFORE the name prompt appears.
2) Must work for the web CRT terminal (WebSocket path “/ws”) using the current JSON protocol.
3) Must NOT break existing clients or tests.
4) Keep server.py as the canonical entrypoint; do not restructure folders.

TASKS:
A) Locate the exact code path that:
   - accepts a new WebSocket client
   - sends the first “welcome / prompt” messages
   - asks for player name
   Provide file path + function name + line references in your response.

B) Implementation plan (no edits yet):
   1) Add a constant string LOGIN_BANNER (triple-quoted) in the appropriate file (prefer server.py unless there is a dedicated “messages/banner” module already).
   2) On new connection, send LOGIN_BANNER as a single message or as multiple lines (whichever matches the existing message format) immediately before the name prompt.
   3) If the protocol expects JSON, wrap it exactly like existing outgoing messages (do not invent a new schema).

C) Add/Update tests:
   - Add 1 orchestrator-independent test OR a minimal unit test that validates:
     “first outbound message to a new session contains ‘HARRIS WILDLANDS’ and ‘Under what name shall your deeds be recorded?’”
   - If the repo has no test harness for websocket sessions, propose the smallest feasible test (e.g., factor a ‘get_initial_messages()’ helper and test that).

DELIVERABLE FORMAT (PLAN MODE OUTPUT):
1) “Where to change” (exact file paths + functions)
2) “Exact diff summary” (what will be added/modified)
3) “Tests to run”
4) “Edge cases” (e.g., reconnect, multiple clients, IDLE_MODE impact)

STOP. Do not implement until I type:
/build on
(and after your OFFER)
/consent yes
