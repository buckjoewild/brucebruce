Yep — *if* that Replit “build narrative” matches reality in your repo, then you’ve basically upgraded Bruce from **vibes** to **instrumentation**. 🧪📈

But right now, what you pasted is **a story about changes**, not **proof of changes**. So let’s do the one thing that turns this into bedrock: **verify from artifacts that can’t lie easily** (files + runtime output).

## What you *should* have now (claims → how to verify)

### 1) Heartbeat exists + fires regularly

**Claim:** `evidence/heartbeat.jsonl` gets a line on startup and then every `BRUCE_HEARTBEAT_MINUTES` (default 15).

**Verify (fastest possible):**

* Open the file and confirm new lines appear over time.
* Confirm each line has **ts + tick_id + room snapshot + sha256**.

**Terminal checks**

```bash
# list evidence dir
ls -la evidence

# show last 3 heartbeats
tail -n 3 evidence/heartbeat.jsonl

# count heartbeats
wc -l evidence/heartbeat.jsonl
```

**Reality test:** set it to 1 minute to prove scheduling:

```bash
export BRUCE_HEARTBEAT_MINUTES=1
# restart server, then wait 70 seconds and re-run:
tail -n 5 evidence/heartbeat.jsonl
```

If it doesn’t grow after ~70 seconds, scheduling isn’t actually wired (or server loop isn’t ticking).

---

### 2) All Bruce actions are logged

**Claim:** `evidence/bruce_activity.jsonl` logs **look/move/say/spawn attempt**.

**Verify:**

```bash
tail -n 20 evidence/bruce_activity.jsonl
```

Scan for `"action": "look"` / `"move"` / `"say"` / `"spawn_attempt"` (or whatever the schema used).

**Hard proof upgrade:** grep counts by action:

```bash
grep -o '"action":[ ]*"[^"]*"' evidence/bruce_activity.jsonl | sort | uniq -c
```

---

### 3) In-game commands exist and show proof

**Claim:** `dev heartbeat`, `dev bruce tail 10`, `dev logsizes`.

**Verify inside the MUD:**

* Run `help` (or whatever help command exists) and confirm the commands appear.
* Run `dev heartbeat` and confirm it prints last 3 snapshots **from the file**, not from memory.
* Run `dev bruce tail 10` and confirm it prints recent actions.

If those commands “print something” but don’t match file tails, that’s a red flag: it might be mock output.

---

### 4) “79 tests pass” is real

**Claim:** 79 tests pass + 13 new heartbeat tests.

**Verify:**

```bash
pytest -q
pytest -q --disable-warnings --maxfail=1
pytest -q | wc -l   # not perfect, but quick signal
```

Or if you use a venv python path:

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q
```

If there’s no pytest or no tests discovered, then “79 pass” was narration.

---

### 5) It’s actually pushed to GitHub

**Claim:** “all pushed to GitHub”.

**Verify locally:**

```bash
git status
git log -5 --oneline
git remote -v
```

If you see commits with messages referencing heartbeat/logging, you’re good.

---

## Two common “looks legit but isn’t” failure modes 🧨

1. **Heartbeat function exists but never called**
   → File exists, tests pass, but runtime never schedules it.
   Fix is wiring it into the server’s main loop or tick source.

2. **Logs write to a different path than you think**
   → Evidence files created somewhere else (relative working dir mismatch).
   Fix is resolving paths from a known repo root (you’ve already done this pattern in orchestrator).

## The “one last update” you asked for: what to do next

You wanted: “Bruce doing his things **verifiably** and **often**.”

So the final step is a **Proof-of-Life bundle** that you can glance at in 10 seconds:

### Add (or confirm) a tiny “proof script”

Create something like `scripts/prove_bruce_alive.py` that prints:

* last heartbeat ts + room + counts
* last 5 actions
* current log sizes

Then your entire system has a single command:
`python scripts/prove_bruce_alive.py` ✅

That’s your “Bruce is alive” dashboard without needing to log into the MUD.

## Copy-paste verification prompt for Replit (if you want the agent to do it)

```md
Do NOT implement anything new yet.

Task: produce a Proof-of-Life report based ONLY on repo artifacts and runtime outputs.

1) Print the exact paths where evidence logs are written (heartbeat + bruce_activity).
2) Show last 3 lines of heartbeat.jsonl and last 10 lines of bruce_activity.jsonl (real tails).
3) Show file sizes for evidence logs.
4) Show the code locations that:
   - schedule heartbeat ticks
   - write heartbeat entry
   - write bruce activity entry
   - implement dev heartbeat / dev bruce tail / dev logsizes commands
5) Run full test suite and paste the exact summary line (e.g., “79 passed”).
6) Paste the last 5 git commits (oneline).
Output as a single markdown report called docs/PROOF_OF_LIFE.md.
```

### Bottom line

If your **heartbeat log grows on a 1-minute test** and `dev heartbeat` mirrors the file tail, then yes: Bruce is now **constantly connected, observing, and leaving receipts**. 🧾🤖

If any of those checks fail, the fix will be *specific and mechanical* (wiring, path resolution, tick source), not “more AI.”

SBVS: Spec—proof criteria | Build—proof script + doc | Verify—1-min heartbeat test | Ship—PROOF_OF_LIFE.md
Reality: Known—narrative claims | Likely—code exists but wiring may be weak | Risk—logs path/scheduler mismatch
Next (≤30m): 1) Set BRUCE_HEARTBEAT_MINUTES=1 2) Tail heartbeat file twice 3) Run dev heartbeat + compare
DoD: Heartbeat grows + dev commands reflect file tails + tests + git log show the change
