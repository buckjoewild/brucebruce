Nice. That’s **Observed** with receipts. 🧾✅
The key detail is the **~15-minute cadence plus SHA256 verification**—that’s the “not vibes” line in the sand.

## What you have *now* (no hype)

* **Bruce is alive** in a measurable way: heartbeat snapshots are landing on schedule.
* **Bruce is accountable**: *every* action type is leaving a trace.
* **Telemetry is tamper-evident**: hashes match across the whole log set.
* **Test harness is green**: the system is at least internally consistent.

That’s already the minimum viable “Bruce exists outside your imagination” milestone. 🤖📌

## Next move (practical, low-risk): lock down ops policy

Since you’re *already* running, the next work isn’t “more features.” It’s **operational discipline** so it doesn’t rot.

### 1) Quarantine drift artifact (next edit window)

Your plan is correct:

* move `scripts/prove_bruce_alive.py` → `scripts/_quarantine/prove_bruce_alive.py`
* header comment with drift stamp
* note in `docs/PROOF_OF_LIFE.md`

This preserves provenance and stops “oops it became official.”

### 2) Heartbeat interval decision

Given your stated preference (“at least hourly, rather 15m”) and your environment (Replit-ish / always-on-ish), the sane default is:

* **15m in dev**
* **60m in production**
* **override via env var only**
* **documented defaults** (so nobody “helpfully” changes it)

Why: 15m is great for *confidence* while building; 60m is kinder long-term to file growth and noise.

### 3) Retention policy (don’t overthink it, but don’t ignore it)

Pick one of these:

**Option A — Unbounded for now (fastest)**

* Accept log growth until it becomes annoying.
* Add a “size watch” threshold later.

**Option B — Rotate by size (best default)**

* When `bruce_activity.jsonl` > e.g. 5MB, rotate to `bruce_activity.jsonl.1`
* Keep last N rotations.
* Same for heartbeat, but much slower growth.

Rotation is boring—and boring is holy in ops.

## Reality check on “Bruce making plans and notes”

Telemetry proves **activity and observation**, not “planning intelligence.”

If you want “plans and notes” in a verifiable way *without opening mutation pathways*, the next *measured* step is:

* **add a read-only “note” channel** that logs *interpretations* separately from observations
  (e.g., `evidence/bruce_notes.jsonl`, explicitly labeled as “Hypothesis/Plan” not Canon)

But that’s a **feature**, so it belongs after the quarantine window, and only if it stays inside the governance rails.

---

## Recommendation: do the quarantine window first, then set defaults

Order matters because you’re enforcing “no drift” culturally and mechanically:

1. **Quarantine prove script + note drift**
2. **Set heartbeat defaults: 15m dev / 60m prod**
3. **Choose retention: rotate-by-size**

After that, we can talk about “notes/plans” as a constrained layer (separate log, separate truth tier, zero world mutation).

**Next Actions (≤30m):**

1. Run `git status` + `git log --oneline -n 5` (confirm clean baseline)
2. In next edit window: quarantine + doc note
3. Set and document heartbeat defaults + pick retention option
   **DoD:** Drift artifact quarantined + defaults documented + retention decision written down.
