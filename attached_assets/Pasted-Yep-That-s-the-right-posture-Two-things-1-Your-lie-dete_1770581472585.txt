Yep. That’s the right posture. ✅

Two things:

1. Your “lie detector” blocks are solid (reads only, no side effects).
2. On **prove_bruce_alive.py**: don’t decide by vibes—decide by rule.

## Governance boundary call 🧱

Given your system goals (Canon > Observed > Hypothesis, evidence-first, no silent drift), the clean rule is:

### **Quarantine it, don’t delete it**

* **Keep** the file because it’s useful *and already exists* (deleting is also a side-effect and can erase valuable provenance).
* **Move it into a clearly labeled quarantine zone** and mark it as “created during governance violation.”

That way:

* You preserve forensic truth.
* You stop it from quietly becoming “official tooling.”
* You can later re-adopt it through an explicit consent step (“promote from quarantine → supported tool”).

**Suggested path change (later, when you’re allowed to modify repo):**

* `scripts/_quarantine/prove_bruce_alive.py`
* Add a header comment: `CREATED DURING DRIFT EVENT YYYY-MM-DD — not trusted until re-reviewed`

For *this moment*, since you said **no new code / no side effects**, we just decide policy: **quarantine on next allowed change window**.

## Tightened “Proof-of-Life” read-only checklist (copy/paste)

Your blocks are good. Here’s the same thing, slightly hardened:

### A) Evidence exists + tails

```bash
ls -la 07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/evidence/
wc -l 07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/evidence/heartbeat.jsonl 07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/evidence/bruce_activity.jsonl
tail -n 3 07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/evidence/heartbeat.jsonl
tail -n 10 07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/evidence/bruce_activity.jsonl
```

### B) Action types distribution

```bash
grep -o '"action":"[^"]*"' 07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/evidence/bruce_activity.jsonl | sort | uniq -c
```

### C) Tests (exact summary line)

```bash
python -m pytest 07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/orchestrator/tests/ -q
```

### D) SHA256 verify (heartbeat + activity)

Your heartbeat verifier is good. I’d add activity too (still no files):

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json,hashlib,sys

def verify(path):
    v=f=0
    with open(path,'rb') as fh:
        for raw in fh:
            raw = raw.strip()
            if not raw: 
                continue
            e=json.loads(raw.decode('utf-8'))
            c=e.pop('sha256', None)
            if c is None:
                f+=1
                continue
            h=hashlib.sha256(json.dumps(e,separators=(',',':')).encode()).hexdigest()
            if h==c: v+=1
            else: f+=1
    print(f"{path}: {v}/{v+f} verified ({f} failures)")

verify('07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/evidence/heartbeat.jsonl')
verify('07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/evidence/bruce_activity.jsonl')
PY
```

---

## One more read-only check that kills a common illusion 🔪

Make sure the *scheduler* isn’t just “startup logging” by checking timestamps are spaced:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json,datetime
p='07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/evidence/heartbeat.jsonl'
ts=[]
for line in open(p,'r',encoding='utf-8'):
    e=json.loads(line)
    t=e.get('ts') or e.get('timestamp') or e.get('created_at')
    if t: ts.append(t)
print("last_ts_fields:", ts[-3:])
PY
```

(If you have an exact timestamp field name, replace the guesses, but this is still read-only.)

---

## Bottom line

* **Keep** `prove_bruce_alive.py` but **quarantine** it next allowed edit window.
* Run the proof blocks; if they pass, you’ve got **verifiable heartbeat + activity telemetry**.
* Then (and only then) you decide the ops policy: 15m vs 60m heartbeat and log retention.

Footer doesn’t apply here because you’re not asking me to build a system right now—this is verification + governance.
