Perfect — here is a single, clean copy-paste block you can drop straight into Replit → Deployment → Adjust settings and then click Publish with confidence.

This assumes safe public launch (MUD live, Bruce active, builds locked).

✅ COPY-PASTE: Replit Publish Setup (SAFE DEFAULT)
1️⃣ Environment Variables (Secrets / Env tab)

Paste each line as its own key/value:

HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=80
IDLE_MODE=1
MUD_BRUCE_AUTOPILOT=true
USE_CODEX=0
CODEX_DRYRUN=1


Why:

PORT=80 matches Replit’s external forwarding

IDLE_MODE=1 guarantees no unattended builds

AUTOPILOT=true lets Bruce roam/chat safely

Codex disabled by default (no surprise code edits)

2️⃣ Build Command

Leave EMPTY

❌ Do not use:

npm run build


This is a Python MUD. No build step.

3️⃣ Run Command

Set exactly:

python server.py

4️⃣ Ports Configuration

KEEP only this:

Host: 0.0.0.0
External Port: 80


❌ Remove / disable:

0.0.0.0 :3000


(That’s leftover web-app baggage and can break routing.)

5️⃣ Deployment Type

Reserved VM ✅
(Required for WebSockets + persistent sessions)

Machine:

0.5 vCPU / 2 GiB RAM ✅ (perfect)

6️⃣ App Access

Choose one:

✅ Anyone on the internet can access your app (recommended)

OR restrict to team if you want a quiet alpha

7️⃣ Security Scan

Leave ON ✅
(No reason to disable.)

🚀 FINAL STEP

After all the above is set:

👉 Click Publish

✅ What “success” looks like after publish

Visit:

https://brucebruce-brosephharris.replit.app


You should see:

CRT terminal loads

HARRIS WILDLANDS ASCII banner

Bruce steward text

Prompt:

Under what name shall your deeds be recorded?


WebSocket connects automatically

/build on ❌ blocked (IDLE_MODE)

/plan hello ✅ works

That means:

Hosting is correct

Ports are correct

WebSockets are correct

Safety posture is correct

🧭 After Publish (no rush)

Next clean steps, when you feel like it:

Add custom domain (harriswildlands.com or mud.harriswildlands.com)

Test local Docker run (escape pod)

Add a simple in-world /status command (IDLE_MODE, last event, memory size)

But right now?

Yes. You are publish-ready.
