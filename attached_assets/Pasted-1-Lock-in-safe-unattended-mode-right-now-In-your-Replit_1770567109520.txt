1) Lock in “safe unattended” mode (right now) 🧹🔒

In your Replit Deployment environment, set:

IDLE_MODE=1

MUD_BRUCE_AUTOPILOT=true (if you want Bruce roaming)

HOST=0.0.0.0

PORT → (leave unset if Replit injects it; otherwise set 5000)

Smoke test in the web terminal:

/plan cleaning-house ✅ should work

/build on ❌ must be blocked

/consent yes ❌ must be blocked

DoD: you can walk away and the AI literally can’t mutate code/world.

2) Domain hookup: do it the Replit way (A + TXT), not vibes 🌐

Replit’s current custom-domain flow is: copy the A + TXT records Replit gives you and paste them into your registrar DNS.

Recommended: use a subdomain for the MUD

mud.harriswildlands.com → MUD

keep harriswildlands.com for your website or a landing page

Steps (actual workflow)

In Replit: Deployments → your Autoscale Deployment → Custom Domains

Add: mud.harriswildlands.com

Replit will show A record value + TXT record value → copy both

In GoDaddy DNS:

Add the TXT record exactly

Add the A record exactly (hostname mud)

Wait for DNS propagation, then Replit should show verified

WebSocket sanity check

After it verifies:

terminal should load at https://mud.harriswildlands.com

websocket should connect to wss://mud.harriswildlands.com/ws

If you’re using Cloudflare in front: avoid “Flexible SSL” (it can cause loops); use Full/Strict.

3) Prove you’re truly host-independent (1 local run) 🐳

When you’re back at your own machine (or any Linux box), run:

docker build -t harriswildlands-mud .

docker run -e HOST=0.0.0.0 -e PORT=5000 -p 5000:5000 harriswildlands-mud

If the terminal loads and /ws connects locally, you’ve validated: Replit is optional.

4) Next build: Commit 3 should be “Bruce memory v1” (not Neo4j yet) 🧠

Given your repo truth map, the clean v1 is exactly what your Replit agent described:

append-only bruce_memory.jsonl in 07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/evidence/

Bruce can reference:

player chat (uncertain)

build events with result: ok (factual)

Bruce cannot write world JSON from memory entries

This gets you “Bruce learning & interacting” without canon corruption.

Copy-paste prompt for Replit PLAN (Commit 3) 🧾

Use this next (PLAN first, then build it):

/plan

GOAL (Commit 3): feat: Bruce memory v1 (append-only) + safe readback in autopilot

CONSTRAINTS:
- No LLM required for v1 (template responses ok).
- Memory must be append-only JSONL stored under 07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/evidence/.
- Memory must never directly mutate world data (rooms.json / npcs.json).
- Bruce may cite facts only from build_event entries with result="ok".
- IDLE_MODE must still prevent all build execution.

TASKS:
1) Add orchestrator/bruce_memory.py
   - append_entry({...}) -> writes one JSON line
   - read_recent(filter...) -> reads last N entries safely
   - tag entries with source: player_chat | build_event | bruce_observation

2) Wire into server.py autopilot loop
   - On player chat: append player_chat entry
   - On Bruce say/action: append bruce_observation entry
   - For “what happened” style prompts: read build_event entries relevant to room/player and respond with "The build log confirms..." wording

3) Tests
   - Add tests that:
     a) appends are append-only (no rewrite)
     b) build_event result!="ok" is not treated as fact in response helper

DELIVERABLE:
- file-cited plan + exact paths
STOP before implementing until /build on + /consent yes
