Yeah—**the plan/order is right**, but that “execution log” you pasted is *not evidence*. It’s exactly the kind of narrated-success that Trey’s audit is trying to kill. 😄🔒

Two hard truths:

1. **I can’t push to GitHub or publish your Replit for you** from here.
2. **You shouldn’t trust that completion report unless you can reproduce it locally** (or in Replit) with commands + diffs + logs.

So here’s the **minimum “make it real” push/publish sequence** you (or Trey) can run. This turns “feels magical” into **provable magic**.

---

## 1) Prove the changes exist (not just claimed)

### A) Confirm you’re on the expected commit base

```bash
git rev-parse --short HEAD
git status
git log -5 --oneline
```

### B) Show what actually changed

```bash
git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD
git diff origin/main...HEAD
```

### C) Re-run the audit commands (the same ones Trey ran)

```bash
python -m pytest 07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/orchestrator/tests -q
npm audit --package-lock-only --omit=dev
pip-audit -r requirements.txt
```

If the new tests are real, you should also see a higher test count (or at least more test files) and your `git diff --stat` should reflect it.

---

## 2) Make the “hardening” claims true (spot-check the criticals)

### A) Auth: unauth clients can’t run commands

Look for these invariants in code (and test it live):

* default role ≠ `human`
* no “command as first message ⇒ human”
* only `/help` `/auth` `/join` (or equivalent) before auth

### B) Artifacts: path traversal blocked

Verify **artifact_id** is either:

* generated server-side, OR
* regex validated and rejects `..`, slashes, drive letters, `:`, etc.

### C) Evidence wording

If you didn’t implement adversarial integrity (HMAC), **docs must say “checksummed,” not “signed.”**

---

## 3) Commit cleanly (don’t dump a mystery blob)

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Hardening + world growth budget (auth gate, artifact sanitization, revert cleanup, growth budget commands + tests)"
```

Optional but smart: include the audit in the repo as evidence.

```bash
mkdir -p docs/audits
# paste Trey's audit into docs/audits/trey-audit-2026-02-09.md
git add docs/audits/trey-audit-2026-02-09.md
git commit -m "Add Trey audit notes (2026-02-09)"
```

---

## 4) Push to GitHub ✅

```bash
git push origin main
```

Then verify it’s actually there:

```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin main
```

(If you’re using PRs, do `git push origin HEAD:hardening-growth-budget` and open a PR.)

---

## 5) Publish / Deploy (Replit reality)

This depends on whether you’re using **Replit Deployments** or just running the repl.

### A) Basic “published” check

* Replit: confirm the repl is public (if intended) and the **web app is reachable**
* Confirm the running process matches the **blessed entrypoint** (the secure one)

### B) Smoke-test the magic loop (live)

From a client session:

1. `/growth status`
2. `/growth propose` (offer appears, no mutation)
3. `/build on`
4. `/consent yes`
5. `/growth apply` (or your apply verb)
6. `/growth status` (budget decremented)
7. `/growth history 10` (events logged)

If any of those steps works without auth from a fresh client, you *still have the hole*.

## The real “today we make it magical” rule ✨

**Magic = small change + proof.**
One new room/NPC/item per day, with a log entry you can point at, and tests that keep you honest.

If you want, I’ll format a **release note** you can paste into GitHub (what changed, why, how to verify) using whatever your actual diff shows—but don’t trust the narrated report until the commands above reproduce it.
