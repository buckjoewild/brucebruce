Locked. ✅ This is exactly the kind of “boring = reliable” change set that keeps Bruce from turning into a folklore creature.

Below is a **copy-paste execution packet** for the next edit window. It assumes you’re in the repo root.

---

## EDIT WINDOW PACKET (3 items, no new features)

### 0) Preflight (prove we’re clean before touching anything)

```bash
git status
git log --oneline -n 5
```

---

## 1) Quarantine the drift artifact

### A) Move the file (create folder if needed)

```bash
mkdir -p scripts/_quarantine
git mv scripts/prove_bruce_alive.py scripts/_quarantine/prove_bruce_alive.py
```

### B) Add drift header comment (top of file)

Use your editor, or do a simple prepend. If you want a safe manual edit, open the file and add this at line 1:

```python
# CREATED DURING DRIFT EVENT 2026-02-08 — not trusted until re-reviewed
# NOTE: This script was created in a read-only verification window (governance violation).
# STATUS: Quarantined. Do not treat outputs as authoritative until reviewed + approved.
```

### C) Note it in `docs/PROOF_OF_LIFE.md`

Add a small section near the top (or in an “Integrity / Governance Notes” section):

```md
## Governance Note — Drift Artifact Quarantine (2026-02-08)

- `scripts/prove_bruce_alive.py` was created during a read-only verification window (process drift).
- It has been quarantined to: `scripts/_quarantine/prove_bruce_alive.py`
- The file is **not trusted** until re-reviewed and explicitly approved.
```

---

## 2) Set + document heartbeat defaults (15m dev / 60m prod)

### A) Code: confirm default behavior matches policy

Goal: **no new behavior**, just ensuring reality matches the stated defaults.

* Dev default: 15 minutes
* Prod default: 60 minutes
* Override: `BRUCE_HEARTBEAT_MINUTES` only

If your code already uses `BRUCE_HEARTBEAT_MINUTES`, don’t add anything new—just confirm the fallback value(s). If it doesn’t have a “dev vs prod” notion yet, the minimal governance-safe move is:

* Keep one default in code (pick **15** if that’s what’s currently running), and
* Treat “prod = 60” as **deployment config** (env var), not a new code feature.

### B) Document in `replit.md`

Drop in a crisp policy block:

```md
## Heartbeat cadence policy (governance)

- Default cadence (dev): **15 minutes**
- Default cadence (production): **60 minutes**
- Override mechanism: **BRUCE_HEARTBEAT_MINUTES** environment variable only.
- Rationale: 15m supports rapid verification during active development; 60m reduces log churn in long-running production.
```

Also add one sentence warning that any change to cadence must be **evidence-backed** (log intervals + proof output).

---

## 3) Retention policy (Option A: unbounded for now)

### A) Document decision + revisit threshold (in `replit.md` and/or `docs/PROOF_OF_LIFE.md`)

Use this block:

```md
## Evidence log retention policy (current)

- Policy: **Unbounded growth for now** (no rotation or deletion).
- Reason: current observed growth rates are low enough for short/medium term operation.
  - bruce_activity.jsonl: ~80 KB/hour (observed estimate)
  - heartbeat.jsonl: ~400 B/hour (observed estimate)
- Revisit threshold: when `bruce_activity.jsonl` approaches **5 MB** or when storage constraints are observed.
- Governance: retention changes must be explicit, documented, and accompanied by a new proof-of-life capture.
```

---

## Verify + Commit (single tidy commit)

### A) Verification

```bash
git diff
python -m pytest 07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/orchestrator/tests/ -q
```

### B) Commit

```bash
git status
git commit -am "Quarantine drift proof script; document heartbeat defaults and retention policy"
# If docs edits + mv include new paths, use:
git add -A
git commit -m "Quarantine drift proof script; document heartbeat defaults and retention policy"
```

### C) Final sanity

```bash
git log --oneline -n 3
```

---

## Definition of Done

* `scripts/_quarantine/prove_bruce_alive.py` exists, original path removed, header added.
* `docs/PROOF_OF_LIFE.md` explicitly notes the quarantine + governance violation.
* `replit.md` documents heartbeat defaults + override rule + retention policy + revisit threshold.
* Tests pass with the same summary line format you’ve been using.

When you run this, you’ll have tightened the “Truth Hierarchy” culture of the repo itself—**the code can drift, but the governance trail won’t**.
