Nice — that’s the right kind of “cosmetic but structural” change: first outbound message, no gameplay/governance edits, tests prove it, and it’s protocol-correct ({"type":"system"}) ✅🧰

A few practical next moves so this doesn’t stay “cool in Replit” and becomes the front door at harriswildlands.com:

1) Lock the unattended safety posture (do this now) 🔒

In Replit Deployment env vars set:

IDLE_MODE=1 ✅ (blocks builds)

MUD_BRUCE_AUTOPILOT=true (optional, if you want him roaming)

HOST=0.0.0.0

PORT leave default unless Replit requires it

Quick validation in terminal:

/plan hello ✅

/build on ❌

/consent yes ❌

That’s your “clean-the-house” guarantee.

2) Make the MUD the actual landing page (domain wiring) 🌐

Since you want the MUD as the landing page, you have two clean patterns:

Pattern A (recommended): root domain stays landing, MUD is root

harriswildlands.com → MUD terminal

Pattern B (safer long-term): root domain landing page + MUD subdomain

harriswildlands.com → simple homepage (later)

mud.harriswildlands.com → MUD

If you truly want the MUD to be the landing right now, do Pattern A and you can always move it to /mud or a subdomain later.

Replit steps:

Replit → Deployment → Custom Domains

Add harriswildlands.com (or mud.harriswildlands.com)

Copy the exact DNS records Replit provides (often A + TXT) into GoDaddy

Verify TLS + confirm WebSocket connects

3) Verify WebSocket over the domain (the only real gotcha) 🧪

Once the domain is live, test in-browser:

Page loads banner ✅

Console shows WebSocket connected ✅

Name prompt appears ✅

If banner loads but WS fails, it’s almost always proxy headers / SSL mode / wrong ws URL. Your docs/hosting.md should already describe the correct reverse proxy settings if you later move to VPS.

4) Make banner editing painless (small improvement idea) ✍️

Right now it’s in server.py as a constant. That’s okay.

When you feel like it, a clean upgrade is:

move banner text into 07_HARRIS_WILDLANDS/evidence/banner.txt or docs/banner.txt

load at startup

tests assert markers still present

Not urgent, just keeps you from editing code for art tweaks.

5) One note on process: your “/build on consent yes” shortcut ⚠️

It worked here, but it’s a habit that can bite you later. The whole point of OFFER → CONSENT is to keep humans from rubber-stamping scope creep.

Practical rule:

Never combine /build on and /consent yes in one paste.

Always wait for OFFER summary first.

That preserves the “physics.”
